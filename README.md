# Do not use this Buildpack, it is extremely experimental, and tailored to my own needs at the moment.

# ASP.NET Core + Angular2 buildpack

This is a [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack)

This is a clone of [noliar's dotnet-buildpack fork](https://github.com/noliar/dotnet-buildpack), made to avoid littering the fork history with my commits.

## To do:

* Modify build so that the ng2 app doesn't have to be prebuilt.
